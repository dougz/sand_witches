    This puzzle was a "scrum": many people on the team could collaborate with a shared view of the puzzle.
    Everyone would see the same clue at the same time, anyone could guess an answer to that clue.
    The server told the team about right clue-answers.
    When the team had all the clue-answers, the server displayed them all.

    Here we show the clues and blanks. There is also a clue-answer checker. (It won't check the puzzle's final
    answer; it only knows about clue-answers.)
