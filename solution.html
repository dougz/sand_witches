  Teams are shown a series of clues. The clues solve to nonsense phrases.
  Each nonsense phrase is the
  result of taking a common "<var>foo</var> in <var>bar</var>" phrase,
  and putting the word <var>foo</var> in the word <var>bar</var> and adding an extra letter.
  <i>E.g.,</i> the nonsense phrase <span class=extra>H</span>ARM <b>UP</b>S is <b>UP</b> in ARMS plus <span class=extra>H</span>.
